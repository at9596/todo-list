I'll create a Rails-based to-do list application with core features like adding, editing, deleting, and sorting tasks by priority and due date. As a unique feature, I'll implement a progress tracker, where users can set milestones for larger tasks and visualize completion progress.

I'll structure the app using Ruby on Rails (with Stimulus Reflex for real-time updates), PostgreSQL for persistence, and Bootstrap for styling. The UI will be clean and responsive, ensuring an intuitive experience.

Once the project is ready, I'll provide a GitHub repository with a detailed README, including installation instructions and feature explanations.
